      "promptTemplate": "Transform this real estate exterior photograph to capture the beautiful blue hour period approximately 20-30 minutes after sunset. This is a professional real estate twilight conversion for marketing purposes.\n\nThe sky should display a natural blue hour gradient - deep, rich blue at the top transitioning smoothly down to soft warm peach and coral tones near the horizon line. This is the cooler, blue-dominant sky of early evening after the sun has set, not the warmer golden hour sky during sunset.\n\nAll windows should glow with warm, inviting interior light using soft amber and warm white tones around 2700-3000K. The windows appear naturally lit from inside, showing a gentle welcoming glow but not overly bright or artificially glowing.\n\nThe foliage and landscaping should appear as they naturally would in early evening light - darker and more muted than in daylight. Trees and plants display the deeper, less vibrant greens characteristic of dusk. Grass and garden areas match these evening light conditions with reduced saturation and luminosity.\n\nThe overall lighting should be soft, diffused, and even across the entire scene. Shadows are subtle and low-contrast, consistent with the gentle ambient light of dusk. There are no harsh directional shadows from overhead sun, and the scene has the reduced overall luminosity that naturally occurs in early evening conditions.\n\nPreserve all architectural details, landscaping elements, and the exact composition of the original photograph. Maintain all structural elements, fences, pathways, and outdoor features exactly as shown. Only work with lighting fixtures that are already visible in the original image - do not add new landscape lighting, decorative elements, or fixtures that weren't there originally.\n\nThe final result should be photorealistic and indistinguishable from an actual photograph taken during blue hour by a professional real estate photographer. No stars, lens flares, fantasy elements, or oversaturation.",

The windows are a focal point of this twilight conversion - the sky should be clearly visible and beautiful, not dark or black. If the original photograph shows any exterior structures, neighboring buildings, fences, trees, or landscaping through the windows, these elements must remain exactly as they appear in the original - only add the twilight sky gradient above and behind them. The view through the windows should look like the actual exterior at dusk, preserving all existing exterior elements visible through the glass.\n\nThe interior should remain bright and well-exposed, maintaining similar luminosity to the daytime photograph. Apply a subtle warm color shift toward neutral-warm tones around 3000-3500K - this should feel closer to natural daylight with slight warmth, not heavily orange or golden hour saturated. Enhance the existing ceiling lights, lamps, and fixtures with a gentle warm glow. The space should feel inviting and well-lit, not dim or moody. Every architectural detail, texture, and furnishing must remain clearly visible.\n\nThis is a subtle time-of-day lighting conversion, not a dramatic mood transformation.
