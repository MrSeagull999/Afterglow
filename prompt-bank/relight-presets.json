The camera angle and perspective must remain unchanged.\n\nThe final result should be photorealistic and suitable for professional real estate marketing.",

The sky should have good color saturation to create an appealing blue hour look, but remain natural and photorealistic. Avoid warm peach, coral, or orange tones in the sky.\n\nWindows should glow with warm interior light around 3500-4000K - inviting and naturally warm but not overly orange or yellow. The interior lighting should appear as it would in a well-lit home during twilight - warm and welcoming without being artificially saturated.\n\nFor naturally lit exterior areas (decks, patios, outdoor spaces), maintain their natural warm character and proper exposure. These areas should show the natural warmth of wood tones and ambient twilight lighting without being artificially cooled or color-shifted. The deck and outdoor surfaces should retain their authentic material colors and natural appearance.\n\nFor interior views, windows should show the beautiful rich blue hour sky outside with the same saturated blue gradient. Interior lighting should have a warm, inviting quality around 3500-4000K - naturally warm and well-lit without excessive orange or yellow color casts. The space should feel welcoming and professionally photographed.\n\nBalance the cool blue sky with warm interior lighting and natural material tones to create an appealing, professional twilight photograph. The lighting should feel authentic and naturally captured, not artificially processed. Maintain all architectural elements, materials, and composition exactly as shown. The camera angle and perspective must remain unchanged.\n\nThe final result should be photorealistic and suitable for luxury real estate marketing with rich colors and natural balance.",
